### What I learned

This project was a nice refresher after long break from serious coding. I was mostly focused on Sass functions, so I learned how to use mixins and variables. But this project also helped with React skills.

### Continued development

There is still much more for me to learn about accessibility. I also want to focus on creating better code and more reusable components.

- [react-docs](https://react.dev/) - This amazing docs served were very usefull in reminding me how react hooks work.
